# Difference Between golang-migrate and AutoMigrate

Both `golang-migrate` and GORM's `AutoMigrate` are used to handle database schema migrations in Go, but they work differently and are suited for different use cases.

## 1. golang-migrate (SQL-Based Migrations)
This method involves writing raw SQL migration files (`.sql`) that explicitly define changes to your database schema.

### ✅ Advantages:
- **Version-controlled:** Each migration is stored as a separate file with a unique sequence number (e.g., `000001_init.up.sql`).
- **Rollback capability:** You can easily revert changes using `.down.sql` files.
- **More control:** You can write custom SQL queries, indexes, constraints, and advanced database operations.

### ❌ Disadvantages:
- Requires writing SQL manually.
- More steps involved in creating and applying migrations.

### Example Usage:
```sh
migrate -path migrations -database "postgres://admin:admin@localhost:5432/ecommerce_db?sslmode=disable" up
```

## 2. GORM AutoMigrate (Code-Based Migrations)
This method automatically generates and updates database tables based on Go struct definitions.

### ✅ Advantages:
- **Less manual work:** It directly converts Go structs into database tables.
- **Easier for prototyping:** If you frequently modify the schema, `AutoMigrate` quickly adapts without writing raw SQL.
- **No extra migration tool required.**

### ❌ Disadvantages:
- **No rollback support:** If a migration goes wrong, you can’t easily undo it.
- **Lacks explicit versioning:** Changes are applied directly without tracking versions.
- **Less control:** Can't handle advanced SQL operations like custom constraints or indexes.

### Example Usage:
```go
db.AutoMigrate(
    &models.User{},
    &models.Product{},
    &models.Order{},
)
```
This will:
- Create tables for `User`, `Product`, and `Order` if they don’t exist.
- Modify existing tables if the struct changes (e.g., adding a new column).

## 🔥 Which One Should You Use?

| Feature | golang-migrate (SQL) | GORM AutoMigrate |
|---------|----------------------|------------------|
| **Version control** | ✅ Yes (uses migration files) | ❌ No (direct changes) |
| **Rollback support** | ✅ Yes (via `.down.sql`) | ❌ No rollback |
| **Customization** | ✅ High (raw SQL) | ❌ Limited (basic table updates) |
| **Ease of use** | ❌ Manual SQL writing | ✅ Automatic table creation |
| **Best for** | Production apps with strict database control | Quick prototyping & small projects |

---

## 🚀 When to Use Which?
- Use **golang-migrate** when you need full control, explicit versioning, and rollback capability (e.g., production environments).
- Use **GORM AutoMigrate** when you are in early development, rapidly iterating, or working on small projects.
